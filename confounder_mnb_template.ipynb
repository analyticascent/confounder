    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This a \"blank slate\" version of [Confounder](https://github.com/analyticascent/confounder) that can be repurposed for whatever subject matter you choose. To use it, you need to produce a starting framework consisting of a **list criteria** of possible *omissions* to look for that are related to the topic of your choosing. Then you need to gather **sample articles** of text that *do* and *do not* meet the various criteria you came up with. Note that each of the criteria you have listed has to be checked independently from the others in order to ensure greater accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the term *articles* and/or *text samples* will be used throughout this notebook file to refer to the passages of text put under scrutiny.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your collection of text samples will be the **training set** of raw text that [Confounder](https://github.com/analyticascent/confounder) uses to learn distinctions between \"accurate\" versus \"inaccurate\" coverage of a topic. To be effective, the collection must be *representative* of things that meet or fail the criteria you choose. *Representative* in this context means articles on a topic that do make one of the errors you have listed as well as samples that do not in as varied of ways as commonly possible. That set could be academic studies, policy papers, news articles, blog posts, even social media posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bear in mind that there is no such thing as true \"fact-checking\" software - anyone claiming otherwise is peddling BS.** [Confounder](https://github.com/analyticascent/confounder) is simply a means of *consolidating* the validation of whether text passages meet pre-defined criteria. That *criteria* can be open to interpretation, as well as whether a training sample *meets or fails* parts of that criteria. And yes, these problems exist in spam filtering as well (of which [Confounder](https://github.com/analyticascent/confounder) is a functional derivative).\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce bias, [Confounder](https://github.com/analyticascent/confounder) is a project geared at detecting *omitted variables* - which is far different from trying to deduce the truth value of statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce these problems, you need to deduce your framework from universally objective rules for accurate research methodology. This image below sums up some of the most fundamental errors any \"X causes Y\" claims need to avoid, and fitting this to a particular political, economic, or scientific issue with minimal value assumptions should be high priority for [Confounder](https://github.com/analyticascent/confounder) users:"

    "Rather than criticize [Confounder](https://github.com/analyticascent/confounder), anyone objecting to conclusions promoted with this tool should critique the *actual framework* used to *train* the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of the code used for this Confounder template is only as good as the *framework* you use to find those kinds of errors. The list of errors and missing variables must be comprehensive but avoid overlap, and the sample articles must be large in number and representative of those unique errors. This will better allow the Confounder notebook scripts to \"learn\" how accurate and inaccurate articles differ from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of the operational nature of this notebook as being a spam filter. You feed in examples of article text that does or does not meet the various criteria in your list. The raw text is then converted to *document-term matrices* which will use the frequency of unique words to distinguish things that meet or fail various criteria. A variant of **Naive Bayes** that treats each word as a variable will then deduce whether *new text samples* are more similar to things meeting or failing a given criteria. These steps are ellaborated on in the notebook's documentation below, so read on to learn about usage."
